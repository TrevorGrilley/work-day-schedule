# work-day-schedule
Create a work day scheduler to help keep you organized! When the application is launched you're greeted with the current day and date. You will also see time boxes going from 9am-5pm. The boxes are color coordinated with the past,present, and future times. The past times are gray, present time is red, and future times are green. You can also type in each individual box and click on the save button to the right of the box. This will save the information you typed to local storage and if you refresh the page all your information will still be there.
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
